## General info
This tool records attribute changes happening in the selected object and apply the same on multiple selections. Usually, Maya provides preset 
a mechanism which works on all attributes of selected objects. 
But if the one wants to change a certain set of attributes then it is bit manual work even if you use spreadsheets. This tool allows to record number of actions a user is doing on selected attribute and apply them on any given selections. It also identifies the same node
types from given selections to apply changes on. So it becomes quite hassle-free for the artists to use. This is mainly useful for rigging, 
animation, layout, environment, and lighting as they play a 
lot with a set of attributes on a daily bases.
